## Everyday Experiment Challenge ##

I decided to make one experiment everyday to keep my brain fresh to build more creative stuff. As you can imagine, one experiment everyday is extremely difficult as:
 1. I got a day job in an advertising agency. You know what is it like if you are working in this industry.
 2. It is hard to keep finding new thing to do.
 3. My girl friend will kill me if I don't have time for her.

Because of those reasons above, I will have to make something small but interesting.
